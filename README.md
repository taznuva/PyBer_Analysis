# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
### Purpose 

Applying Python skills and knowledge to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type from the Module. Once the summary DataFrame is created and using Pandas and Matplotlib, we will create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type to analyze how these differences can be used to make an informed decision by the makers at PyBer. 

## Results

As shown in the DataFrame below, Urban cities had the most number of rides, drivers, and the highest amount of total fares. Rural cities had the least number of rides, drivers, and lowest amount of total fares. Rural has the highest average fare per ride and average fare per driver. We can infer that this is because rural cities has the least number of rides and drivers, the fare rates are higher. Suburban cities have a median average between urban and rural cities.

The graph below also shows a visual representation of the huge difference between Rural and Urban cities. Rural has the least amount of total fares and Urban the highest. It also shows similar pattern for all types of cities. All three types peaked high in late Feb which is also the highest total fare both Urban and Suburban cities reached and Rural cities peaked high in April.

## Summary

Granted that Rural cities have the least amount of rides and drivers, it also has the highest average fare per ride and driver. This can be due to the fact there may not be enough demand in rural cities, but if the company wanted to increase demand in rural cities one recommendation would be to lower the fare rates. Another recommendation to follow up on the first, is that they can also hire more drivers in the area. 
If their goal is to reduce the disparity between each city type, they can also increase the fare rate in Urban cities to reduce. This may reduce the amount of fare rides, but it would increase the average fare per driver.
